### What the hack is this?

This is a weekly update repo of my planning & learnings from running a SAAS called [NotionCommerce](https://notioncommerce.com). Kind of like a knowledge base you can say.

### So.. Why is this public?

To keep myself commited. IDK it's more taugh to fail in public, So I'm hoping by making my commitments in public will kind of force me finish my task within the time period. 
And also I love to follow other founder's jurney and in case you are someone like me, hopefully this will be somewhat interesting to you as well.
